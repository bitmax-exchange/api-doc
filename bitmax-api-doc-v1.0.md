Bitmax | API Document v1.0
==============================================

Note: we changed our API URLs on 2018-08-24. Even though the old URLs still work, you are strongly recommended to
use the new URLs as described on this page.

Basics  
---------------------------------------------

### Product Symbols

The exchange adopted format `baseAssetCode/quoteAssetCode` for product symbols. For instance, `ETH/BTC = 0.052` means the price of 1 ETH is 0.052 BTC. Althought not required,
it is recommended to use `ETH-BTC` in API paths to avoid polluting the path string.


Public RESTful APIs

Authenticated RESTful APIs
----------------------------------------------

Private RESTful API entry point: `https://bitmax.io/<account-group>/api/<version-num>` (see API Entry Point section below for details)

### Authentication

To use the authenticated RESTful APIs, you need to first apply for an API key and a secret key to sign the message. You should
include the API key in each of your request along with a signature signed using the secret key. Please don't share the secret
key with anyone. (Please contact us to obtain your keys.)

Each authenticated request must include the following fields in the header:

* `x-auth-key` - the API key
* `x-auth-signature` - the message signed using __sha256__ using the __base64-decoded__ secret key
  on the prehash string `{timestamp}+{api_path}`, or `{timestamp}+{api_path}+{coid}` for placing/canceling orders.
* `x-auth-timestamp` - milliseconds since UNIX epoch in UTC
* `x-auth-coid` - this field is only required when placing a new order or canceling an order, see below for details

For instance, to query all your balance through api path `balances` at `2018-06-26 20:49:34.012 UTC` (timestamp=`1530046174012`),
you could obtain the signature by applying the sha256 algorithm to string `1530046174012+balances`. The signing process can be implemented
in python 3.6+ as:

    # python 3.6+
    import hmac, hashlib, base64

    key = "eb1vhzkNbG...Gw19EsWP6x"  # a secret key that you should
                                     # never share with others

    msg = bytearray("1530047198600+balances".encode("utf-8"))

    hmac_key = base64.b64decode(key)
    signature = hmac.new(hmac_key, msg, hashlib.sha256)
    signature_b64 = base64.b64encode(signature.digest()).decode("utf-8")  

    print(signature_b64) # the signature of interest

__Remark__: to place a new order or to cancel an order, you should include order ID in the message:

    coid = "lx3r...R9Lo"
    msg = bytearray("1530047198600+order+{}".format(coid).encode("utf-8"))

__Remark__: to place or cancel multiple orders, you should include all order IDs in the message:

    coids = "+".join(["lx3r...R9Lo", "ck8e...pE91", "Xlds...1Sce"])
    msg = bytearray("1530047198600+order/batch+{}".format(coids).encode("utf-8"))

Please note that we will switch to a new signing method from 2018-09-26 onward. Although you can still use the algorithm above, you are encouraged to switch 
to the new signing method.

    # python 3.6+
    import hmac, hashlib, base64

    key = "eb1vhzkNbG...Gw19EsWP6x"  # a secret key that you should never share with others

    msg = bytearray("1530047198600+balances".encode("utf-8"))

    hmac_key = bytearray(secret.encode("utf-8"))  
    signature = base64.b64encode(hmac.new(hmac_key, msg, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest())

    print(signature) # the signature of interest


### API Entry Point

BitMax assign dedicated servers to users within the same **account group**. This greatly increases the per-user throughput of each server.
API users are expected to specify the account group in the query URL in order to connect to the desired server. Otherwise, the request
will be rejected.

The API entry point for authenticated APIs is `https://bitmax.io/<account-group>/api`. For instance, the user with account group 3 should
use `https://bitmax.io/3/api` to query authenticated data.

Account group is expected stay the same over time. However, it is recommended that API users check the account group at the begining of the
program. Refer to `GET user/info` for how to get account group.  

### API Calls with Input Data

Some API calls require user input data. The server only accept JSON as input type, please make sure you specify the data type in the request header:

    }



### Orders

#### Stages of an Order's Life Cycle 

An order may be in one of the following `status`:

* `New`
* `PartiallyFilled`
* `Filled`
* `Canceled`
* `Rejected` 

#### Place a New Order (`api_path=order`)

    POST <account-group>/api/v1/order

For this API you must include `x-auth-coid` in your request header.

Request body schema: `application/json`

    FieldName    FieldType    Example         Description
    ---------    ---------    -------         -----------
    coid         string       "xxx...xxx"     a unique identifier  
    time         long         1528988100000   milliseconds since UNIX epoch in UTC  
    symbol       string       "ETH/BTC"       
    orderPrice   string       "13.5"           
    orderQty     string       "3.5"           
    orderType    string       "limit"         currently we only support limit order
    side         string       "buy"           buy or sell
    postOnly     boolean      true            Optional, if true, the order will either be posted to the limit order book or be cancelled, i.e. the order cannot take liquidity; default value is false

Each request should contain a unique identifier `coid`. `coid` is no more than 32-charaters and consists of only lower case characters (`a-z`),
upper case characters (`A-Z`) and digits (`0-9`).  

Each request should also specify `time` - the request time as the total milliseconds since UNIX epoch in UTC. Requests placed more than 30 seconds ago are treated as expired and will not be processed.

Success response:

    {
      "status": "success",   // status = success means the server has processed the request
      data: {
        "coid": "xxx...xxx",
        "action": "new",
        "success": true  // success = true means the order has been submitted to the matching engine. 
      }
    }

Response code `200 OK` means the order has been received by the server. However, it doesn't imply that the order has been successfully 
submitted to the matching engine. API users should use the `success: boolean` field in the API response to check if the order has been successfully passed to the system. For instance, if one doesn't have enough balance, he/she will get `success = false`.

Even if the order has been passed to the matching engine, it might still be rejected. For example, postOnly order can be rejected if the order would otherwise take liquidity. API users should use the list open order API to monitor the status of the order placed. (see below)

#### Placing Multiple Orders (`api_path=order/batch`)

You may combine multiple orders into one request

    POST <account-group>/api/v1/order/batch

For this API, you must include `x-auth-coid` in your request header. You must concatenate IDs of all orders with character `+`. The order of IDs in the header 
must match the orders in the request. 

You may submit up to 10 orders at a time. Server will respond with `InvalidRequest` if you submit more than 10 orders.

Request body: `application/json`

    {
      "orders": [
        {
          "coid":       "xxx...xxx",
          "time":       1528988100000,  // timestamp, must be the same for all orders 
          "symbol":     "ETH/BTC",
          "orderPrice": "13.5",
          "orderQty":   "3.5",
          "orderType":  "limit",
          "side":       "buy"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

Successful response: an object containing a list of `(symbol, orderId)` 

    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": [
        ["ETH/BTC", "xxx...xxx"],
        ...
      ]
    }


#### Cancel an Order (`api_path=order`)

    DELETE <account-group>/api/v1/order

For this API you must include `x-auth-coid` in your request header.

Request body schema: `application/json`

    FieldName   FieldType    Example         Description
    ---------   ---------    -------         -----------
    coid        string       "xxx...xxx"     a unique identifier, see POST api/order for details

    origCoid    string       "yyy...yyy"     the coid of the order to cancel

    time        long         1528988100000   milliseconds since UNIX epoch in UTC,
                                             see POST api/order for details

    symbol      string       "ETH/BTC"

You must correclty specify the `origCoid` in order to cancel an open order. The exchange will reject the request if it cannot find
any open order using the provided `origCoid`.

Response code `200 OK` means the order has been placed successfully in our system. API users should use websocket to monitor the
status of the order placed.

#### Cancel Multiple Orders (`api_path=order/batch`)

You may delete multiple orders in the single request:

    DELETE <account-group>/api/v1/order/batch

For this API you must include `x-auth-coid` in your request header. You must concatenate IDs of all orders with character `+`. The order of IDs in the header 
must match the orders in the request. 

You may submit up to 10 orders at a time. Server will respond with `InvalidRequest` if you submit more than 10 orders.

Request body: `application/json`

    {
      "orders": [
        {
          "coid":       "xxx...xxx",
          "origCoid":   "yyy...yyy",
          "time":       1528988100000,  // timestamp, must be the same for all orders 
          "symbol":     "ETH/BTC",
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

Successful response: an object containing a list of `(symbol, orderId)` 

    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": [
        ["ETH/BTC", "xxx...xxx"],
        ...
      ]
    }

          "status":      "PartiallyFilled"
        },

### Get Deposit address of one Asset (`api_path=deposit`)

    POST <account-group>/api/v1/deposit/<asset>

Request body schema: `application/json`

    {
      "requestId": "xxx...xxx",     # a unique identifier  
      "time":       1528988100000,  # milliseconds since UNIX epoch in UTC  
      "assetCode": "ETH"
    }

You must sign the message `"<timestamp>+deposit+<requestId>"`, and set `x-auth-coid=<requestId>` in the header.

Successful response: one object with the the deposit address associated with the authenticated user.

    {
        "data": {
            "address": "0x481de74994f2ebf85d29b5462026af73b0d4e062"
        },
        "email": "<your-email-address>",
        "status": "success"
    }

### Request 

al of one Asset (`api_path=withdraw`)

        POST <account-group>/api/v1/withdraw
        
Request body schema: `application/json`

    {
      "requestId": "xxx...xxx",      # a unique identifier  
      "time":       1528988100000,   # milliseconds since UNIX epoch in UTC  
      "assetCode": "ETH",
      "amount":    "1.23",
      "address": {
        "address": "0x1234..."
      }
    }

You must sign the message `"<timestamp>+withdraw+<requestId>"`, and set `x-auth-coid=<requestId>` in the header.

The address is a key/value pair object, the object structure for each asset should be the same as the deposit response. For most asset, such as `BTC` and `ETH`, the address contains a single key `address`. For other assets, the address might contain more fields. 

A withdrawal requet can have 3 possible states:

Success:

    {
        "msg": "Your withdrawal request is being processed.",
        "status": "success"
    }
Rejected:

    {
        "msg": "Your withdrawal request has been rejected.not enough position",
        "status": "error"
    }
Need manual review:

    {
        "msg": "We have received your withdrawal request and it is currently under manual review.",
        "status": "success"
    }


WebSocket API
----------------------------------------------

WebSocket entry point: `wss://bitmax.io/<account-group>/api/stream/[symbol]`

Similiar to Authenticated servers, BitMax assign dedicated servers to stream data to users in the same account group  
via websocket. For instance, user in account group 3 will subscribe all `ETH-BTC` messages via:

    wss://bitmax.io/3/api/stream/[symbol]

**Note:** [symbol] in websocket connections must be seperated by a hyphen(-), e.g, ETH-BTC. Slash(/) is treated specially in URLs as path separators.

### Websocket Authentication

Connecting to websocket API follows almost the same authentication process as the authenticated RESTful APIs. You
need to add the following headers to your websocket request:

* `x-auth-key`
* `x-auth-signature` - the message signed using __sha256__ using the __base64-decoded__ secret key
  on the prehash string `{timestamp}+api/stream"`.  
* `x-auth-timestamp`

Once the websocket is connected, you need to send a `subscribe` message in order to start receiving data streams.
Currently we stream three type of messages.

* `depth` - market depth
* `marketTrades` - market trades
* `order` - client's own orders.

All webSocket messages are in JSON format and are very similar to RESTful APIs. However, the field names are shortened
to reduce message size.  


### Subscribe to WebSocket Streams

After connecting to websocket, you need to send an `subscribe` message in order to start receiving data streams.

    {
      "messageType":         "subscribe",  // message type

      "marketDepthLevel":    20,           // max number of price levels on
                                           // each side to be included in
                                           // the first market depth message  

      "recentTradeMaxCount": 20,           // max number of recent trades to
                                           // be included in the first market
                                           // trades message  
    }


### Market depth

Each market depth message is a JSON object containing the current quantity at specific
prices levels. There is no direct way of getting the top-of-the-book data. You need to maintain the
current depth book and derive the best bid/ask. This can be done by two steps:

1. Use the first `depth` message to build the initial depth book.  
2. Use later messages to update the depth book. Messages contain the new total size at the
   indicated price level. You should replace the old quantity using message received. When the
   replacement quantity is zero, it means there is no order sitting on the corresponding price level.

All `depth` messages have the same structure:

    {
       "m": "depth",             // message type
       "s": "ETH/BTC",           // symbol
       "asks": [                 // ask levels, could be empty
           ["13.45", "59.16"],   // price, quantity
           ["13.37", "95.04"],   
           ...
       ],
       "bids": [                 // bid levels, could be empty
           ["13.21", "60.17"],
           ["13,10", "13.39"],
           ...
       ]
    }


### Market Trades

Once you send the `subscribe` message, you will start receiving continuous market trade stream. All market trades messages
follow the same structure, which contains one or more trades.

    {
      "m": "marketTrades",      // message type
      "s": "ETH/BTC",           // symbol
      "trades": [
        {
          "p":  "13.75",         // price
          "q":  "6.68",          // quantity
          "t":  1528988084944,   // timestamp
          "bm": False            // if true, the buyer is the market maker
        },
        {
          "p":  "13.75",         // price
          "q":  "6.68",          // quantity
          "t":  1528988084944,   // timestamp
          "bm": False            // if true, the buyer is the market maker
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

### Market Summary

Each market summary data record contains current information about a single product. The data is streamed in batches - we stream 
out market data of all products every 30 seconds. 

    {
      "m":  "summary",
      "s":  "ETH/BTC",     // product symbol
      "ba": "ETH",         // base asset
      "qa": "BTC",         // quote asset 
      "i":  "1d",          // for market summary data, the interval is always 1d
      "t":  1528988000000, // timestamp in UTC
      "o":  "3.24",        // open
      "c":  "3.56",        // close
      "h":  "3.77",        // high
      "l":  "3.21",        // low
      "v":  "10.234",      // volume
    }


### Bar Chart Data

Bar data is almost the same as the market summary data, except that:
  
* Message type is `bar` 
* There is only one symbol per websocket session
* The interval field `i` may take multiple values: `1`, `5`, `30`, `160`, `360`, `1d`.  

We stream bar data in batches. Every 30 seconds, we stream bar data messages at all interval levels. You may use 
these data to update bar chart directly (replace bars). However, you should also update the bar chart using the 
market trade messages.  

    {
      "m":  "summary",
      "s":  "ETH/BTC",     // product symbol
      "ba": "ETH",         // base asset
      "qa": "BTC",         // quote asset 
      "i":  "5",           // 1/5/30/60/360/1d
      "t":  1528988500000, // timestamp in UTC
      "o":  "3.24",        // open
      "c":  "3.56",        // close
      "h":  "3.77",        // high
      "l":  "3.21",        // low
      "v":  "10.234",      // volume
    }


### Order Management

With our websocket API, you can monitor the status of all your active orders, place new orders, and
cancel existing orders.


#### Order updates

Once connected to websocket streams, you will start receiving real time updated of your own orders. It
contains both order execution report and current balances.

    {
      "m":      "order",            // message type
      "coid":   "xxx...xxx",        // client order id, need to cancel order
      "s":      "ETH/BTC",          // symbol
      "ba":     "ETH",              // base asset
      "qa":     "BTC",              // quote asset
      "t":       1528988100000,     // timestamp
      "p":      "13.45",            // order price
      "q":      "3.5",              // order quantity
      "f":      "1.5",              // filled quantity
      "ap":     "13.45",            // average price
      "bb":     "10.00",            // base asset total balance
      "bpb":    "12.00",            // base asset pending balance
      "qb":     "1.0",              // quote asset total balance
      "qpb":    "0.8513",           // quote asset pending balance
      "fee":    "0.00012",          // fee
      "fa":     "ETH",              // fee asset
      "side":   "buy",              // side
      "status": "PartiallyFilled"   // order status
    }

Since only new order updates will be streamed, it is recommendated that you load the initial snap of all you orders
using the RESTful API `GET api/v1/order/open`.


#### Place a New Order with WebSocket

To place a new order, you need to send to the server a `newOrderRequest`:

    {
       "messageType": "newOrderRequest",
       "time":        1528988100000,  // current timestamp
       "coid":        "xxxx...xxx"    // a 32-character unique client order Id
       "symbol":      "ETH/BTC",      // symbol
       "orderPrice":  "2.23",         // order price
       "orderQty":    "34.3",         // order quantity
       "orderType":   "limit",        // always limit
       "side":        "buy"           // buy / sell
    }

The client order Id field (`coid`) is a unique id to identify your order. Once the order
is successfully placed, this Id will be echod back in the `origCoid` field of the order update
message.


#### Cancel an Order with WebSocket

To cancel an order, you need send to the server a `cancelOrderRequest`:

    {
      "messageType": "cancelOrderRequest",   // message type
      "time":        1528988100000,          // current timestamp
      "coid":        "xxxx...xxx",           // a 32-character unique client order Id
      "origCoid":    "yyyy...yyy",           // the coid of the order to be canceled   
      "symbol":      "ETH/BTC"               // symbol
    }
